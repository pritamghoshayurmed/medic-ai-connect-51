# GitHub Repository Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to push your Medic AI Connect application to GitHub:

## 1. Create a New Repository on GitHub

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and sign in to your account
2. Click on the "+" icon in the top right corner and select "New repository"
3. Name your repository (e.g., "medic-ai-connect")
4. Add a description (optional): "A modern healthcare platform connecting patients and doctors with AI-powered tools"
5. Choose visibility (Public or Private)
6. Do NOT initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these files)
7. Click "Create repository"

## 2. Push Your Code to GitHub

After creating the repository, you'll see instructions for pushing an existing repository. Follow these steps in your command line:

```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd medic-ai-connect-51

# Configure Git if you haven't already
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"

# Initialize Git repository (if not already initialized)
git init

# Add all files to the repository
git add .

# Commit the files
git commit -m "Initial commit"

# Add the remote repository URL (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/medic-ai-connect.git

# Push the code to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

## 3. Verify Your Repository

1. Refresh your GitHub repository page
2. You should see all your code files and the README.md file
3. The README.md file will be displayed on the main page of your repository

## 4. Share Your Repository

Now you can share the URL of your GitHub repository with others:
```
https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/medic-ai-connect
```

## 5. Clone the Repository (For Team Members)

Others can clone your repository using:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/medic-ai-connect.git
cd medic-ai-connect
npm install
npm run dev
```
