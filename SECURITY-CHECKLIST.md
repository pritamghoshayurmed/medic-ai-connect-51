## 🔍 Security Verification Steps

### 1. Environment Variables Check

```bash
# Verify no hardcoded values in these files:
grep -r "AIzaSy" src/ --exclude-dir=node_modules
grep -r "firebase" src/config/ 
grep -r "supabase" src/config/
```

### 2. Git History Check

```bash
# Check for accidentally committed secrets
git log --all --full-history -- .env
git log --all --full-history -- "*.key"
git log --all --full-history -- "*secret*"
```

### 3. Build Verification

```bash
# Ensure no secrets in production build
npm run build
grep -r "AIzaSy" dist/ || echo "✅ No API keys in build"
grep -r "password" dist/ || echo "✅ No passwords in build"
```

### 4. Network Security Test

```bash
# Test HTTPS redirect
curl -I http://your-domain.com
# Should return 301/302 redirect to HTTPS

# Test security headers
curl -I https://your-domain.com
# Should include security headers
```

## 🚨 Critical Security Configurations

### Supabase Security Settings

```sql
-- Verify RLS is enabled
SELECT schemaname, tablename, rowsecurity 
FROM pg_tables 
WHERE schemaname = 'public';

-- Check RLS policies
SELECT schemaname, tablename, policyname, permissive, roles, cmd, qual 
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE schemaname = 'public';
```

### Firebase Security Rules

```json
// Realtime Database Rules
{
  "rules": {
    "chats": {
      "doctor-patient": {
        "$chatId": {
          ".read": "auth != null && (auth.uid == data.child('doctorId').val() || auth.uid == data.child('patientId').val())",
          ".write": "auth != null && (auth.uid == data.child('doctorId').val() || auth.uid == data.child('patientId').val())"
        }
      },
      "ai-history": {
        "$userId": {
          ".read": "auth != null && auth.uid == $userId",
          ".write": "auth != null && auth.uid == $userId"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

```javascript
// Storage Rules
rules_version = '2';
service firebase.storage {
  match /b/{bucket}/o {
    match /medical-images/{userId}/{imageId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
  }
}
```

### Vercel Security Headers

```json
{
  "headers": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "headers": [
        {
          "key": "X-Content-Type-Options",
          "value": "nosniff"
        },
        {
          "key": "X-Frame-Options", 
          "value": "DENY"
        },
        {
          "key": "X-XSS-Protection",
          "value": "1; mode=block"
        },
