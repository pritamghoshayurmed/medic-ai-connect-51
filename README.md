## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 16+
- npm or yarn
- Supabase account (optional for full functionality)
- Google Gemini API key is already hardcoded for demo purposes

### Environment Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. The app is preconfigured with a Gemini API key, so you don't need to set it up for testing the AI functionality
3. If you want to use your own API key, you can update it in the `.env.local` file:
   ```
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-url
   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key
   VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=your-gemini-api-key
   VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
   ```

### Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build
```

The app will be available at http://localhost:8081

## Gemini API Implementation

This application uses the Gemini 2.0 Flash Lite model for AI functionality. The API is called directly using axios:

```typescript
// Example direct API call to Gemini
const response = await axios.post(
  `https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-2.0-flash-lite:generateContent?key=${apiKey}`,
  {
    contents: [{
      parts: [{ text: prompt }]
    }]
  },
  {
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    }
  }
);
```
